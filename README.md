# Hi, I'm Sanyog Rathore! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! 🎉 I'm a passionate **Full Stack Developer** with a love for building interactive, responsive web applications and solving real-world problems using modern technologies. From frontend frameworks to backend magic, I do it all! 💻✨

## 🚀 About Me:
- 🔥 I’m always excited to learn and work on new technologies.
- 🛠️ Skilled in **React**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, **Express**, and much more!
- 🧠 I love dabbling in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and creating scalable, maintainable code.
- 🌍 I'm a believer in making the web accessible to everyone!

## 🌟 My Awesome Projects:

### [Frontend Responsive](https://github.com/sanyorat/Frontend_responsive) 🌐
A responsive front-end project using modern web development practices. This one’s a masterclass in mobile-first design, with **Ant Design** and **React Router** providing the backbone. Oh, did I mention it's **i18n ready** too? 🌍

### [Assign_Backend](https://github.com/sanyorat/Assign_Backend) 🖥️
A simple backend using **Node**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**. It retrieves intents from frontend messages and responds with a random answer from a predefined stack. Let’s just say, this is where logic meets fun! 🎲🧠


## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools:
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Redux, MUI, Ant Design
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Apollo Server, Graphql
- **Other**: Docker, Kubernetes, Webpack, Parcel
- **Languages**: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Python, Java

## 🎯 What I’m up to:
- 🔭 Currently exploring **Next.js** and **React Native** for cross-platform magic! ✨
- 📚 Sharpening my **TypeScript** skills and diving deep into backend integrations.
- 💬 Always up for a conversation on **web development**, **AI**, or just geeking out on tech in general.
